# raspberry-pi-utils

This is a collection of useful Raspberry Pi shell scripts.

**These scripts have only been tested with the Raspbian Linux distro.**

Each of these scripts are designed to be executable directly from GitHub using a simple one-liner like:

```sh
sudo bash <(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomasleplus/raspberry-pi-utils/master/setup/create-new-login.sh)
```
But for more advanced (or security-conscious) users, I always recommend downloading scripts and reviewing them before executing them, especially when using `sudo`.

## [Setup](setup)

These scripts are typically used during the initial configuration of a new Raspberry Pi.
